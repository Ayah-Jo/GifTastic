# GifTastic

This is a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice.

The current topic being used is about world countries. But you can add or remove any topic of your own liking.

When the user clicks on a button, the page should grab 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and place them on the page.

When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing.

Enjoy "gifing" around.
